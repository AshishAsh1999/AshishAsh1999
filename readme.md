About Me

I am a data driven professional with nearly three years of experience in SQL based analytics, dashboarding, and automated reporting. I specialise in transforming raw, complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that support data informed decision making.

I recently completed an MSc in Data and Computational Science from University College Dublin. My professional background includes hands on experience with SQL development, Tableau dashboards, data quality validation, and workflow automation within a SaaS environment.

At PowerSchool, I worked on K-12 educational analytics solutions used by school administrators and educators, where I designed BI dashboards, streamlined reporting pipelines, and improved data accuracy through structured validation and analysis.

I am comfortable working across SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, and I enjoy bridging the gap between technical data work and business understanding.
